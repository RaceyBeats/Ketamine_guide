Clinical trials have been contradictory. We performed a systematic review of randomized, double-blind clinical trials of ketamine added to opioid analgesia. Thirty-seven trials with 51 treatment arms and 2385 patients were included. Studies were divided into 5 subgroups: IV ketamine as single dose (n = 11), continuous infusion (n = 11), patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) (n = 6), epidural ketamine with opioids (n = 8), and studies in children (n = 4). Outcome measures included pain scores, time to first request for analgesia, supplemental analgesics, and adverse events. Efficacy was estimated by statistical significance (P < 0.05) of outcome measures as reported in studies and also by calculation of weighted mean difference for pain scores during the first 24 h after surgery. As compared to morphine alone, IV PCA with ketamine and morphine did not improve analgesia. Intravenous infusion of ketamine decreased IV and epidural opioid requirements in 6 of 11 studies. A single bolus dose of ketamine decreased opioid requirements in 7 of 11 studies. Five of 8 trials with epidural ketamine showed beneficial effects. Adverse effects were not increased with small dose ketamine. We conclude that small dose ketamine is a safe and useful adjuvant to standard practice opioid-analgesia.}}

Adjuvant treatment with an inexpensive opioid-sparing drug such as ketamine may be of value in giving better analgesia with fewer adverse effects. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of ketamine administered peri-operatively in the treatment of acute post-operative pain in adults. Methods: Studies were identified from MEDLINE (1966—2004), EMBASE (1980—2004), the Cochrane Library (2004) and by hand searching reference lists from review articles and trials. The manufacturer of ketamine (Pfizer AS, Lysaker, Norway) provided search results from their in-house database, PARDLARS. Randomized and controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients undergoing surgery, being treated with peri-operative ketamine, placebo or an active control were considered for inclusion. Results: Eighteen trials were excluded. Thirty-seven trials were included. Twenty-seven out of 37 trials found that peri-operative ketamine reduced rescue analgesic requirements or pain intensity, or both. Quantitative analysis showed that treatment with ketamine reduced 24-h patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine consumption and post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Adverse effects were mild or absent. Conclusion: In the first 24 h after surgery, ketamine reduces morphine requirements. Ketamine also reduces PONV. Adverse effects are mild or absent. These data should be interpreted with caution as the retrieved studies were heterogenous and the result of the meta-analysis can not be translated into any specific administration regimen with ketamine.}}

This paper reviews the use and efficacy of adding low dose ketamine to morphine in management of acute post-operative pain in patients who perceive pain in spite of large consumption of morphine and added advantages of decreasing opioid consumption and there by resulting in minimizing dose related side effects. We conducted a randomized double blind study on 120 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. All patients were kept in PACU post operatively and were given basal analgesia with IV morphine till maximum of 100µg /kg within 30 min period, but if patient still complained of pain (≥6 of 10 on VAS) with an acceptable cognition state (≥15 in the MMSE) and who rated themselves not sedated (≥5 of 10 on VAS) were taken as resistant to morphine and were enrolled in one of the two treatment groups. The MS group received 3 boluses of 30 µg/kg of morphine plus saline whereas MK group received 3 boluses of 15 µg of morphine plus 250 µg/kg of ketamine. The total dose of morphine required by MK patients (0.42±0.12 mg/kg) was significantly less than MS patients (1.21±0.43mg/kg). (P<0.0001). The quality of analgesia was in favor of MK group even in terms of rescue analgesia as amount of diclofenac required was double in MS patients than in MK patients.

The problems arising afterwards not only have a pathophysiological adverse effect on patients, but also detrimentally affect the health system, treatment costs, and delay in discharge, for which pain management should be planned prior to surgery, and the resulting stress (1-3). Recent studies indicate a high incidence of persistent postoperative pain, and anesthesiologists should thus take proactive measures to control postoperative pain, particularly as some surgeries have more severe acute pain. Not only have a variety of drugs (such as opioids, NSAIDs, and adjuvants) been studied, but also several methods of administration (including oral, intravenous, epidural, inhalation, etc.) have been evaluated (4-6). Because of having significant effect in pain management, opioids are the most commonly prescribed drugs, but considering their side effects, researchers have always been looking for alternative or adjunctive drugs and methods. Of adjuvants, paracetamol, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, gabapentin, pregabalin, lidocaine, amantandine, melatonin, and ketorolac, can be considered, in the meantime, for their role in post-operative pain management (79). As well as systemic administration of drugs, a variety of regional techniques including neuraxial and peripheral nerve blockade are of great attraction to anesthesiologists for pain management during and after surgery (10-12). Opioids are the most prominent postoperative pain management drugs; however, the analgesic requirement may gradually grow up due to the possibility of hyperalgesia. Administration of sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine seems to be able to prevent this phenomenon, thereby preventing hypersensitivity and drug tolerance (13). In recent studies, special attention has been paid to ketamine. Ketamine is a noncompetitive inhibitor of NMDA receptors, having analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antihyperalgesic effects, which has made it achieve a new position in postoperative pain management. Ketamine has not only been considered for acute postoperative pain management, but has also been used for peri-operative pain management, pre-emptive analgesia, multimodal analgesia, chronic pain, and controlling hemodynamic changes during intubation (14). In addition, as an adjuvant in regional anesthesia, such as peripheral nerve block, it has had significant effects (15). However, it is associated with some side effects, such as hemodynamic changes, hallucinations, and headaches, which may interfere with the postoperative recovery. Psychosomatic complications such as mood disorders and dissociative symptoms are among the most common, but transient; with problems associated with this drug disappearing usually in one hour. Central nervous system complications may also be present, but they are not common if administered as an adjuvant in patient controlled analgesia (PCA). Ketamine administration has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neuraxial methods, and neurotoxicity has been observed in intrathecal continuous infusion of its racemic mixture, which, of course, appears to have occurred due to its preservative content, as no such cytotoxic effects have been observed in intrathecal administration of the preservative free type. Intranasal ketamine has a higher bioavailability than oral, and some studies have shown it to be effective in acute pain management following outpatient surgery procedures in children; psychosomatic effects have also been observed with this method, however (16). In the studies available, the addition of ketamine to morphine has not always been associated with acute postoperative pain relief, and has had varied effects. In some studies it has delayed the time for the first postoperative analgesic request. On the contrary, low doses of ketamine during the operation has not affected morphine}}

The problem is not limited to major surgery; even common minor procedures such as hernia repair have a significant risk of chronic pain. Surgical technique can influence the development of chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) and techniques to minimise nerve injury should be used where possible. Central nervous system changes contribute to the development of persistent pain following surgical trauma and nerve injury. Pharmacological agents that interrupt the mechanisms contributing to central sensitisation may be helpful in reducing the incidence of CPSP. Psychosocial factors are also important in the development of chronic pain and should be addressed as part of a holistic approach to perioperative care.}}

After family doctors and internists, orthopaedic surgeons are the third-highest prescribers of opioids among physicians in the United States [9]. The vast majority of surgical patients receive opioids in the peri-operative period, including many for the first time in their lives [4], and it is during this time when patients are at risk for developing opioid dependence. Thus, the concept of multimodal and opioid-reduced or opioid-free perioperative pain management has gained prominence [8]. In fact, a recent editorial in Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research offered modest approaches to opioid-reduced painmanagement that orthopaedic surgeons should consider including writing smaller prescriptions for shorter periods of time, reassessing whether to use long-acting opioid medications in narcotic-naı̈ve patients, and setting realistic expectations about pain after surgery [7]. Several potential alternatives to opioids have been proposed and investigated, such as ketamine. Ketamine is a medication that provides analgesic, amnestic, and dissociative effects in a dose-dependent manner [11]. There are, however, safety concerns with ketamine including central nervous system symptoms such as hallucinations [10]. In this Cochrane review, the authors investigate the efficacy and safety of ketamine as an adjunct for postoperative pain in adult patients. The authors included 130 blinded, randomized controlled trials (8341 participants) comparing ketamine to either placebo, an opioid medication, or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. Overall, the authors found that peri-operative ketamine reduces pain, nausea, vomiting, and the use of opioids after surgery.}}

Since chronic pain can be severe in about 2–10% of these patients, persistent postsurgical pain represents a major, largely unrecognised clinical problem. Iatrogenic neuropathic pain is probably the most important cause of long-term postsurgical pain. Consequently, surgical techniques that avoid nerve damage should be applied whenever possible. Also, the effect of aggressive, early therapy for postoperative pain should be investigated, since the intensity of acute postoperative pain correlates with the risk of developing a persistent pain state. Finally, the role of genetic factors should be studied, since only a proportion of patients with intraoperative nerve damage develop chronic pain. Based on information about the molecular mechanisms that affect changes to the peripheral and central nervous system in neuropathic pain, several opportunities exist for multimodal pharmacological intervention. Here, we outline strategies for identification of patients at risk and for prevention and possible treatment of this important entity of chronic pain.}}

This systematic review update evaluated the effectiveness of systemic drugs to prevent chronic postsurgical pain. METHODS The authors included double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials including adults that evaluated perioperative systemic drugs. Studies that evaluated same drug(s) administered similarly were pooled. The primary outcome was the proportion reporting any pain at 3 or more months postsurgery. RESULTS The authors identified 70 new studies and 40 from 2013. Most evaluated ketamine, pregabalin, gabapentin, IV lidocaine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids. Some meta-analyses showed statistically significant-but of unclear clinical relevance-reductions in chronic postsurgical pain prevalence after treatment with pregabalin, IV lidocaine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Meta-analyses with more than three studies and more than 500 participants showed no effect of ketamine on prevalence of any pain at 6 months when administered for 24 h or less (risk ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.36 to 1.07]; prevalence, 0 to 88% ketamine; 0 to 94% placebo) or more than 24 h (risk ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.12]; 6 to 71% ketamine; 5 to 78% placebo), no effect of pregabalin on prevalence of any pain at 3 months (risk ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.10]; 4 to 88% pregabalin; 3 to 80% placebo) or 6 months (risk ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.47 to 1.28]; 6 to 68% pregabalin; 4 to 69% placebo) when administered more than 24 h, and an effect of pregabalin on prevalence of moderate/severe pain at 3 months when administered more than 24 h (risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.68]; 0 to 20% pregabalin; 4 to 34% placebo). However, the results should be interpreted with caution given small study sizes, variable surgical types, dosages, timing and method of outcome measurements in relation to the acute pain trajectory in question, and preoperative pain status. CONCLUSIONS Despite agreement that chronic postsurgical pain is an important topic, extremely little progress has been made since 2013, likely due to study designs being insufficient to address the complexities of this multifactorial problem.

The widespread variability in patient selection, treatment parameters, and monitoring indicates a need for the creation of consensus guidelines.  Methods  The development of acute pain ketamine guidelines grew as a corollary from the genesis of chronic pain ketamine guidelines. The charge for the development of acute pain ketamine guidelines was provided by the Boards of Directors of both the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the American Academy of Pain Medicine, who approved the document along with the American Society of Anesthesiologists9 Committees on Pain Medicine and Standards and Practice Parameters. The committee chair developed questions based on input from the committee during conference calls, which the committee then refined. Groups of 3 to 5 panel members and the committee chair were responsible for answering individual questions. After preliminary consensus was achieved, the entire committee made further revisions via e-mail and conference calls.  Results  Consensus guidelines were prepared in the following areas: indications, contraindications for acute pain and whether they differ from those for chronic pain, the evidence for the use of ketamine as an adjunct to opioid-based therapy, the evidence supporting patient-controlled ketamine analgesia, the use of nonparenteral forms of ketamine, and the subanesthetic dosage range and whether the evidence supports those dosages for acute pain. The group was able to reach consensus on the answers to all questions.  Conclusions  Evidence supports the use of ketamine for acute pain in a variety of contexts, including as a stand-alone treatment, as an adjunct to opioids, and, to a lesser extent, as an intranasal formulation. Contraindications for acute pain are similar to those for chronic pain, partly based on the observation that the dosage ranges are similar. Larger studies evaluating different acute pain conditions are needed to enhance patient selection, determine the effectiveness of nonparenteral ketamine alternatives, define optimal treatment parameters, and develop protocols optimizing safety and access to care.}}

The role of the NMDA receptor in the processing of nociceptive input has led naturally to renewed clinical interest in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists such as ketamine. This paper reviews the use and ef®cacy of low-dose ketamine in the management of acute postoperative pain. The literature was obtained from a computer search of the MEDLINE database from 1966 through December 1998. Studies were included for review if they were randomized, prospective, controlled, double-blind and reported pain scores. We evaluate the clinical literature and discuss the ef®cacy of low-dose ketamine in the management of acute postoperative pain when administered alone or in conjunction with other agents via the oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous and intraspinal routes. Low-dose ketamine is de®ned as a bolus dose of less than 2 mg/g when given intramuscularly or less than 1 mg/kg when administered via the intravenous or epidural route. For continuous i.v. administration low-dose ketamine is de®ned as a rate of #20 mg/kg per min. We conclude that ketamine may provide clinicians with a tool to improve postoperative pain management and to reduce opioid related adverse effects. The evidence suggests that low-dose ketamine may play an important role in postoperative pain management when used as an adjunct to local anesthetics, opioids, or other analgesic agents. Further research is required in the following areas: (a) dose-®nding studies for ketamine as an adjunct to opioids and local anesthetics (b) ef®cacy and optimal route of administration (c) the role of S(1)-ketamine; (d) the in ̄uence of ketamine on long-term outcome such as chronic pain (e) long-term physical and chemical stability of mixtures containing ketamine (f) spinal toxicity of ketamine and (g) effects of low-dose ketamine on cognitive and memory functioning after surgery. q 1999 International Association for the Study of Pain.
