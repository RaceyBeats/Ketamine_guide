# Stopping Low-dose Ketamine

IV and oral low-dose ketamine should be used short term when managing acute pain, usually for 72-96 hours. Patients receiving low dose ketamine will be reviewed daily by the acute pain team and any concerns should be escalated to the on-call anaesthetist out of hours.  
Ketamine can be discontinued abruptly, as ketamine is not addictive when used short termly, and should not cause any physical or mental withdrawal symptoms. However, it can titrated down to ensure the patient does not experience a sudden return of pain. It would also be advisable to discontinue strong opioids prior to the discontinuation of ketamine, as patient can experience rebound hyper anelgesia.
