# Contraindications

Most contraindications are not absolute

+	Allergy to ketamine (absolute)

+	Previous history of ketamine abuse and dependence;  however, this criterion should not serve as an exclusionary factor for patient consideration

+	Pregnancy

+	Schizophreniform psychosis


Caution should also be taken for patients who may suffer from the following:

+	Acute porphyria 

+	Raised intracranial pressure (although the evidence suggests ketamine may be neuroprotective) 

+	Uncontrolled hypertension

+	Ischemic heart disease

+	Psychiatric conditions

+	Confusion 

+	Epilepsy

Ketamine is metabolised by the liver; therefore, hepatic clearance is required to terminate the effects of the ketamine. A prolonged duration of action (increased contex sensitive half-time) may occur in patients with cirrhosis or other types of hepatic impairment, so dose reductions should be considered in these patients. Ketamine undergoes renal excretion; however, there is no requirement for dose adjustment in patients with underlying renal dysfunction in the dose ranges suggested in this guideline.
