# Side effects

Research has shown in low doses ketamine, the majority of people experience either mild or an absence of adverse effects. Unlike opioids, hypotension and respiratory depression are not common side effects associated with Ketamine, due to its positive inotropic effect, and ability to preserve respiratory drive. However, the most common side effects associated with ketamine are dysphoria and hallucinations. 

## Sedation

If sedation score of 2 or more or patient unarousable, stop the ketamine infusion and any opioid medications, get immediate help and administer oxygen therapy. Naloxone does not have any effect on ketamine, however it should be considered if the patient is receiving any concurrent opioids and has sedation score of 2 and/or has respiratory depression. If sedation score is 1, the infusion rate should be reduced by half. If the patient is receiving oral ketamine, to omit the next dose and request a member of the pain service to review the dosage and reassess analgesia. 

## Respiratory Depression

This is usually associated with rapid IV bolusâ€™s of ketamine, however if in the event, discontinue the infusion if respiratory rate is below 8 breaths/ minute. Discontinue any other concurrent opioids, administer oxygen therapy and get immediate help.

## Dysphoria, Hallucinations, Vivid Dreams

Ketamine can cause a dissociative effect and can lead to dysphoria and hallucinations, however at sub-anaesthetic doses this should be rare. In the event of a patient experiencing this, please reassure the patient, and depending on the severity; either reduce the rate by half or pause infusion for one hour and re assess. If the patient is receiving oral ketamine, to omit the next dose and request a member of the pain service to review the dosage.
