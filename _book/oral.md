# Oral ketamine

Where possible, ketamine should be chosen to be administered orally, as there is less risk of error. Oral ketamine is prescribed as oral suspension (50mg/ 5ml) electronically, which is also a schedule 2 controlled drug and will require two registered nurses to administer the drug on EPMA. Oral ketamine can be administered on any base medical or surgical ward, as there is no requirement for additional vital signs monitoring. For the treatment of acute pain, low dose oral ketamine will usually be only prescribed for 72 hours, however the pain service will review the patient daily and the dose and frequency can be titrated accordingly.
Starting doses: 
Usually 25mg, 6 hourly however this will be titrated by the pain service to a maximum of 400mg per day (100mg, 6 hourly).
